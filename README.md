## Local Development & Testing

### Prerequisites

In order to deploy the services into your local environment, you must have the following set up or configured:

- Docker / Docker Desktop
- docker-compose version `2.24.0` or above

### Optional .env file

A `.env` file beside the docker-compose files can be optionally included for customization. All variables available to config already has default values. See [example.env](./example.env) on what can be configured.

### Build & Start

To run all of the services, run the following commnad:

``` sh
docker-compose up
```

If you only wanted to deploy only one of the service, include the `-f` flag followed by the docker-compose file you're trying to deploy. e.g:

``` sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gateway.yml up
```

### Teardown

To teardown the services, run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

To teardown a specific service if you only ran one of them, include the `-f` flag followed by the docker-compose file you're trying to deploy. e.g:

``` sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gateway.yml down
```

include the `-v` flag if you need to remove the created volumes as well.


## Cloud Deployment

TBA at a later sprint.
